alignment of forces is, however, changing as the voice of the general public is at last being heard.", "Contrary to the myths that have been peddled by the tobacco industry, public consultations are revealing the true extent to which the British people oppose being subjected to second-hand smoke.", "For example, the \u2018Big Smoking Debate\u2019 organized by the London Health Commission

of second-hand smoke, something the tobacco industry has striven hard to refute as part of a campaign sustained over many years to prevent the introduction of bans on smoking in public places.",

revealing how exposure to second-hand smoke is considerably more dangerous than was previously believed.3 This is consistent with recently discovered tobacco industry documents showing that second-hand smoke is even more harmful, volume for volume, than directly inhaled smoke.4 Yet the industry continues to place the highest priority on preventing the introduction of restrictions on smoking in public places and has been especially active in spreading misinformation about the effects of the bans in Ireland and New York.", "The main reason it has pursued this policy with such

tobacco smoke.9", "The third argument, and one with which it has had some success so far in the United Kingdom, is that the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants will reduce takings,

recent evidence is from New York where, in the 9 months after a ban on smoking in public places was introduced, sales tax receipts on food and drink increased by 12 per cent and employment in the

tobacco industry has striven hard to refute as part of a campaign sustained over many years to prevent the introduction of bans on smoking in public places.", "There is now an overwhelming consensus among independent tobacco researchers that exposure to second-hand smoke causes many deaths, with recent research using more precise measures of exposure revealing how exposure to second-hand smoke is considerably more dangerous than was previously believed.3 This is consistent with recently discovered tobacco industry documents showing that second-hand smoke is even more harmful, volume for volume, than directly inhaled smoke.4 Yet the industry continues to place the highest priority on preventing the introduction of restrictions on smoking in public places and has been especially active in spreading misinformation about the effects of the bans in Ireland and New York.", "The main reason it has pursued this policy with such tenacity is clear; bans, together with increased taxation, are the most effective ways of reducing smoking overall.5 However, it is also concerned that to concede that second-hand smoke is harmful would undermine its argument that smoking is a matter of personal choice.", "The strategy pursued by the industry has several elements.", "One, now largely discredited, has been to attack the link between second-hand smoking and disease has included commissioning research, some of which was fraudulent and some simply designed to mislead, undermining the communication of research showing the harm caused by second-hand smoke, and lobbying

that the force of ventilation that would be required is far beyond the capacity of existing systems and would be similar to sitting outside during a gale.8 It is important to be aware that many harmful components of tobacco smoke are odourless and the tobacco industry has put much effort into masking the smell and visibility of environmental tobacco smoke.9", "The third argument, and one with which it has had some success so far in the United Kingdom, is that the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants will reduce takings, and thus sales tax and employment.", "To sustain this, it has engaged in a wide-ranging campaign directed at the hospitality industry.", "Yet, like its other arguments, this too is false.", "The most recent evidence is from New York where, in the 9 months after a ban on smoking in public places was introduced, sales tax receipts on food and drink increased by 12 per cent and employment in the hospitality industry increased.10 However, the most convincing evidence comes from a systematic review of research on the impact of bans on bar and restaurant revenue.11 The details results merit study.", "The authors examined 97 studies of the
