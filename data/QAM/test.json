law, which determine the scope of protection according to the subject-matter.", "However, competition law may further regulate this balance where the exploitation of intellectual property restricts competition in a way or to an extent that it is not justified for the protection of its specific subject-matter.", "And whether that is the case can generally be tested by comparing competition in all aspects (including innovation and quality) resulting from the conduct in issue with the competition that would otherwise exist, taking into account the existence, ownership and justified scope of the intellectual property rights (the counterfactual).", "If the comparison is negative, competition law should in principle intervene.", "Both intellectual property and competition law enable economic operators to profit by doing better than other economic operators and thereby encourage them to strive to do so, that is to compete.", "But whether more innovation, better quality, or more efficient
